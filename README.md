# Requirements for Demo

At first, deploy the given contract in the contract folder to a local blockchain like Ganache. We can also use metamask wallet for deployment. 

Once deployed, we can register as a Voter or a Candidate using different addresses. The application for now supports only two candidates for election, we can use it for multiple candidates too.
